                    Denyce is extremely knowledgeable and caring.  Her workouts are challenging yet safe.  Even in a group setting, I feel like I have a focused, personal trainer.

                <p>
                    I have trained with Denyce for a long time. She is an excellent trainer, varies the routine every time, is attuned to what your body needs, challenges me every time, encourages me when I feel like I can’t do the last few reps, and helps me reduce the stress in my life. I have had a number of trainers over the years and she is the very best. She truly cares about you and wants to help you on your fitness journey.

                    This fitness class is a full body workout. The classes are instructed in such a way that both beginners and experienced  people get an optimal workout in the same class. Personal attention (corrections) along the way to ensure you get the most out of your workout.
                </p>
