		<h2>Contract</h2>
		
		<p>
			I, Tyler J. Holley agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2022, ITIS3135, Web App Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
			I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
			I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where i have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
