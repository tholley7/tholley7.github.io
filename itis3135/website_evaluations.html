		<h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
		
        <h3>Good CRAP Design: <a href="https://www.apple.com" class="evaluation-source">Apple.com Homepage</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Contrast</strong><br>
                Apple's website uses a very simple method of maintaining good contrast. Even though their color scheme is generally pretty basic (black, grey, and white), the brand uses that combined with large hero images for their various products to create great contrast.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Repetition</strong><br>
                The home page of Apple's website uses repetition to display each of their most recent products. At the time of writing this: the iPhone 13 Pro, the iPhone 13, and the Apple Watch Series 7. Each of these elements has a header with the name of the product, a tagline for the product, and links to learn more about or buy the product.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Alignment</strong><br>
                All of the text on the homepage is centered within each element. At first, the major elements (iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13, and Apple Watch Series 7) span the whole width of the window. Then, the site contains some minor articles and deals that are smaller and each take up half the width of the page with some nicely sized margins between them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Proximity</strong><br>
                As mentioned in the previous element, the proximity of elements on Apple's Home page is well implemented. They use small margins between elements that are sized thoughtfully so that they look well.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bad CRAP Design: <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/"  class="evaluation-source">The Million Dollar Homepage</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Contrast</strong><br>
                The contrast on this site is truly horrendous. Not only are the tiny images in the main body of the site often indistinguishable from one another but the text in the footer, for example, is almost the same shade of grey as the background of the footer. The colors are also aggressively bright which is fitting for this style of website.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Repetition</strong><br>
                There is virtually no use of repetition on this site. The images in the body of the site are all crammed together with no discernible pattern whatsoever.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Alignment</strong><br>
                As mentioned in the "Repetition" section, the body images are all crammed together with no pattern to their alignment. In the header, the navigation is well spaced out and aligned but every other element has odd margins/padding. The same can be said for the footer.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Proximity</strong><br>
                This page is simple. There's not much more to say so I feel like I am beating a dead horse with this but <em>the images are all smashed together</em>. The proximity of every element on the page, not even just the body images, is extremely tight which means that the flow of reading the site is compromised.
            </li>
        </ul>
