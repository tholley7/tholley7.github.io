            File Management/Naming
        </h3>
        <p>
            The file naming for the files within the project directory are all properly formatted. There are no spaces or capital letters in any of the file or folder names. The words in the folder names are properly separated by an underscore. Additionally, all of the file types are separated into the proper folders (e.g. images are in the images folder).
        </p>

        <h3 class="review-header">
            Styles
        </h3>
        <p>
            Each page has congruent styles applied to them. The file is properly named as "default.css" with a separate stylesheet for the products page called "products.css". The congruent styles applied to each page keep the design consistent across pages. Within the files, all of the formatting is consistent and well-implemented.
        </p>

        <h3 class="review-header">
            Page Design
        </h3>
        <p>
            The fonts chosen for the site are nice! There is a script font chosen for the logo on the Home page as well as a condensed sans-serif font chosen for page headings. However, the font used for the captions in the Products slideshow is the default "sans-serif" browser font. This could be improved by choosing a third font for the site that fits the rest of the site. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The colors of the site are very nice and the format suits them nicely. The background is a nice muted green color with white text. The only black/white part is the nav bar but that works well since it is not the predominant style across the site. 
        </p>
        <p>
            All links are properly formatted so that the default visited and hover properties have been removed or altered to fit the site design. There aren't any links, other those found in the nav bar, to speak of.
        </p>
        <p>
            One shortcoming of the site's design is that, aside from the home page, there is no indication of the site/brand title on other pages. This could be improved by adding a logo or the simply the site title in bigger/bolded text on the far left side of the navbar.
        </p>
        <p>
            The footer has a copyright and there are validation buttons at the bottom but they look out of place with the nice design of the rest of the site. One solution would be to convert them to hyperlinks.
        </p>

        <h3 class="review-header">
            Validation
        </h3>
        <p>
            The validation buttons have a small underline between them. As per the checklist, this can be fixed with "text-decoration: none;" styling. Both validation links end with "referer".
        </p>
        <p>
            There is an error in the HTML validation. This is due to the logo implementation line using a value with a percentage (75%) instead of a number (e.g. 100).
        </p>

        <h3 class="review-header">
            Page Code
        </h3>
        <p>
            Each page has a all the necessary elements (header, main, footer, etc.) as well as proper indentation throughout. All divs, classes, and ids appear to be intentional and none are erroneous.
        </p>
